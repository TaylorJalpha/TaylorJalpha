<h1 align="left">👋 Hello, I'm Taylor J. Ferguson</h1>

## About Me
As a **Technical Product Manager** with a strong foundation in **web and mobile development**, I bridge the gap between **strategy and execution**. My background spans **product management**, **frontend development**, and **technical leadership**, allowing me to drive innovation across diverse verticals and business models.

I blend **strategic thinking**, **creative problem-solving**, and **technical expertise** to develop products that address user pain points, ensure technical feasibility, and have a positive business impact. I’ve successfully led cross-functional teams of engineers, designers, and data professionals, effectively translating complex requirements into actionable roadmaps and measurable outcomes that drive revenue and high customer satisfaction.
