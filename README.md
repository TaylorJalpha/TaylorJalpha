  Hello _Friend, I'm Taylor J Ferguson
</h1>

## üåÑ About me 

<p>
As an experienced generalist <b>Product Manager (PMC)</b>, Web Dev, and Software Biz Dev, I can bridge the gap between technical, design, and business teams. Throughout my career, I've been building web applications. Either through consulting, side projects or to support the teams I've led as a Product Manager. This experience has equipped me with a deep understanding of business logic, technical execution, systems architecture, and thus, the intricacies of leading high-performance engineering teams. My approach involves continuous learning through rapid feedback cycles and test-driven product management. Hypothesis-based and data-driven decision-making‚Ä¶ 
</p>

<p>
  My consulting work and current market conditions have forced me to improve my technical skills, especially Ruby on Rails for backend development and JavaScript for frontend development, to control my professional outcomes and ensure employability. As the tech landscape rapidly evolves, my web development expertise will be a valuable asset for driving successful product management-based initiatives and unlocking new business opportunities.
</p>
